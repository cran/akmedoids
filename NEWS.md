### R Markdown

'Akmedoids' package updated (Version: v0.1.1)

### Updates:

The followings are the two updates to the package.

1. 'statPrint' function is modified as follows:
  (a) 'reference' argument is added in order to allow different reference lines to measure groups' angular deviation.
  (b) 'N.quant' argument is added to allow a more comprehensive assessment of angular deviations of groups. 
  (c) 'bandw' argument is removed (as it is no more necessary because of (a) and (b))

2. A 'vignette' folder added. The folder contains items necessary to render a worked example (.html) based on the package.
